# Hi, Im Ana! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, drawn to product management, data, and machine learning. I care about building things that people genuinely wantâ€”and making sure those things are shaped by the realities and contexts of the people using them.
